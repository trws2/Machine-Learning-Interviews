# AI ML Just-In-Time (JIT):

This repo is cloned and modified from [Machine-Learning-Interviews](https://github.com/alirezadir/Machine-Learning-Interviews) which aims to provide update to original content, as the field is involving very rapidly. It does NOT mean to provide an authorized guide to MLE interview, but serves as a repo to organize my knowledge based on my experiences and understanding working as a MLE with applications from ML Production Services, NLP, and CV.
